# Minimal ASP.NET Web API with JWT Authentication

This project is a minimal implementation of an ASP.NET Web API with JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
The API includes a secure endpoint that returns user information for authenticated requests. 
This README provides an overview, setup instructions, and guidance on testing the API using Postman.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a secure ASP.NET Web API with JWT authentication, allowing only authenticated users to access specific API endpoints. 
JWT authentication provides a secure, token-based authentication model suitable for protecting user data and enabling user-specific access to resources.

## Project Setup

### Setting up the Project

1. Create a new ASP.NET Web API project and install the necessary dependencies for JWT authentication.
2. Configure `appsettings.json` with JWT settings (key, issuer, audience) and database connection string.

## JWT Authentication Implementation

### Implementing JWT Authentication

1. Create a service to generate and validate JWT tokens, which includes encoding user-specific claims in the token.
2. Configure token validation settings to ensure the validity of each token, including signature and expiration checks.

### Creating the Protected Endpoint

1. Create a protected API endpoint that returns the authenticated userâ€™s information.
2. Use the `[Authorize]` attribute to restrict access to authenticated users only.

## Testing the API with Postman

1. **Run the API**: Start the API locally.
2. **Obtain a JWT Token**: Use Postman to authenticate and retrieve a JWT token with valid credentials.
3. **Access the Protected Endpoint**: Send an authorized request to the secure endpoint with the JWT token in the `Authorization` header (formatted as `Bearer <token>`).
4. **Verify User Information**: Confirm that the response includes the authenticated user's details, verifying successful authentication.

## Conclusion

This minimal ASP.NET Web API demonstrates the implementation of JWT authentication to secure API endpoints. 
By using JWT, the API ensures secure, authenticated access to its resources, making it a strong foundation for more complex applications requiring user-based access control.
